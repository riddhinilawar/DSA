Bipartite Graph

There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:
There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.
Return true if and only if it is bipartite.
 
Example 1:
 
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
Example 2:
 
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
 
Constraints:
graph.length == n
1 <= n <= 100
0 <= graph[u].length < n
0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1
graph[u] does not contain u.
All the values of graph[u] are unique.
If graph[u] contains v, then graph[v] contains u.
Our goal is trying to use two colors to color the graph and see if there are any adjacent nodes having the same color.
Initialize a color[] array for each node. Here are three states for colors[] array:
0: Haven't been colored yet.
1: Blue.
-1: Red.
For each node,
If it hasn't been colored, use a color to color it. Then use the other color to color all its adjacent nodes (DFS).
If it has been colored, check if the current color is the same as the color that is going to be used to color it. (Please forgive my english... Hope you can understand it.)


BFS Solution:

class Solution {
    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        int len = graph.length;
        int[] colors = new int[len];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (colors[i] != 0) continue;
            Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
            queue.offer(i);
            colors[i] = 1;   // Blue: 1; Red: -1.
            
            while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                int cur = queue.poll();
                for (int next : graph[cur]) {
                    if (colors[next] == 0) {          // If this node hasn't been colored;
                        colors[next] = -colors[cur];  // Color it with a different color;
                        queue.offer(next);
                    } else if (colors[next] != -colors[cur]) {   // If it is colored and its color is different, return false;
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
