Given an array arr[] which is sorted and rotated, the task is to find an element in the rotated array (with duplicates) in O(log n) time. 
Note: Print the index where the key exists. In case of multiple answer print any of them

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = {3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3}, key = 3 
Output: 0 
arr[0] = 3

Input: arr[] = {3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3}, key = 11 
Output: -1 
11 is not present in the given array.
