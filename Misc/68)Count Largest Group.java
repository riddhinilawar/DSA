Count Largest Group                                                         LC-1399
You are given an integer n.
Each number from 1 to n is grouped according to the sum of its digits.
Return the number of groups that have the largest size.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 13
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of numbers from 1 to 13:
[1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
There are 4 groups with largest size.
Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.
 
Constraints:
â€¢	1 <= n <= 104
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
