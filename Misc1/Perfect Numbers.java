Perfect Numbers

Given a number N, check if a number is perfect or not. A number is said to be perfect if sum of all its factors excluding the number itself is equal to the number. Return 1 if the number is Perfect otherwise return 0.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
Output:
1 
Explanation:
Factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6.
Excluding 6 their sum is 6 which
is equal to N itself. So, it's a
Perfect Number.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
Output:
0
Explanation:
Factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 and 10.
Excluding 10 their sum is 8 which
is not equal to N itself. So, it's
not a Perfect Number.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isPerfectNumber() which takes an Integer N as input and returns 1 if N is a Perfect number else returns 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(sqrt(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1012


class Solution {
    static int isPerfectNumber(long N) {
        // code here
     long sum = 1l, i=2l;
 
    // Find all divisors and add them
    while(i*i<=N){
        if (N % i==0){
            if(i * i != N)
                sum = sum + i + N / i;
            else
                sum = sum + i;
        }
        i++;
    }
    // If sum of divisors is equal to
    // n, then n is a perfect number
    if (sum == N && N != 1)
        return 1;
 
    return 0;
    }
};
